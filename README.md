# hangman-game
Hangman is a word-guessing game where one player thinks of a word, and the other(s) guess letters. Each correct guess reveals the letter in the word. Incorrect guesses lead to drawing parts of a stick figure. The game ends when the word is guessed or the drawing is complete. The goal is to guess the word before the drawing finishes.
